# Notes

Some things you need to watch for.

## Max index

!> The max index is 1000

```js
console.log(array[iwanttocountfromone(1001)]);
>> Too high
```

## Counting from 0

!> Don't do it.

```js
console.log(array[iwanttocountfromone(0)]);
>> NO COUNTING BY ZERO!!!
```

## Seriousness

!> Not too serious.
